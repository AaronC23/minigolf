# Roadmap for `entities` branch

Right now, collision physics are working for the **boundaries** of the canvas, and on the edges and (kind of) the corners of simple rectangular **objects**. I (Rob) am working on a more sophisticated system for collision detection and ball deflections, possibly for **polygons with an arbitrary number of vertices** rather than just rectangles. I was also thinking about a **gesture-based style of play**, where the mouse represents a putter which becomes active as left-mouse is pressed. I could then calculate the velocity of the ball from the velocity of the cursor, as a rate of change in position between two points in time.

For now I'm experimenting outside the repo with breaking collision detection into its own class or set of classes. Shouldn't take to long to come back with a result if you guys are happy for me to proceed. Let me know if you want to know how anything works so far; I haven't done much documentation yet because what's there was thrown together on Sunday, but I'll come back to that ASAP.
